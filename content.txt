Who I am
content
I'm a student-athlete at Andover High School. I'm currently at the end of my freshman year in High School. I'm a straight A student that is always looking for challenges. I view myself as someone who is smart and determined to succeed. I'm driven by my competitve nature and I'm always striving to be the best. 

Stuff I do
content
One of my favorite things to do is play hockey. I have a passion for the sport, and its always fun to skate out on the ice. I've been playing hockey for about 7 years since I was 8. I've played on various teams and our teams are usually bad, but I still loved playing. I love connecting with other people through hockey. This past year I played for the U15 Islanders selects, the U16 Vallery Jr. Warriors, and the Andover High School JVA team. 

One more thing
I enjoy playing video games when I want to relax and unwind. Outside of hockey, I also do Kung Fu. I'm part of the demonstration team, and I sometimes do lion dancing. I started when I was four years I, and I've haven't stopped since then.
