Stuff I do content
One of my favorite things to do is play hockey. I have a passion for the sport, and its always fun to skate out on the ice. I've been playing hockey for about 7 years since I was 8. I've played on various teams and our teams are usually bad, but I still loved playing. I love connecting with other people through hockey.

What I do in my free-time content
I enjoy playing video games when I want to relax and unwind. I also enjoy hanging out with my friends. We don't often meet up, but when we do, it's really fun. We usually either go to a movie or we watch a hockey game together. Some of them don't even understand the rules of hockey, but its still fun just to talk to them and spend time together.
